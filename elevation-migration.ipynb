    "# Sea level rise and migration \n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "* Sea levels will rise in the future due to global warming \n",
    "* Many cities will be affected by this sea level rise\n",
    "* How will different cities be affected by sea level rise? How many people will have to move? \n",
    "\n",
    "What this project will do: \n",
    "* Pick out top 100 (?) most populous coastal cities (hopefully this will include cities in all continents, except for antartica) \n",
    "* Using elevation and population data, find out what percentage of land mass will go underwater, and how many people will have to migrate \n",
    "* Analyze (???) \n",
    "\n",
    "Caveats / limitations: \n",
    "* Rising sea levels doesn't automatically equal migration - some may choose to elevate or reinforce their homes against rising waters \n",
    "* For a more academically rigourous approach, see papers on migration prediction [here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2010.0291), and caveats of migration predictions [here]() and [here](). "
